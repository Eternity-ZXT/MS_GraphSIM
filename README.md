MS-GraphSIM is an objective metric for point cloud quality assessment. This full-reference metric is a multiscale metric that correlates well with human visual characteristics.

Before running MS_GraphSIM, please install GSPbox first (https://github.com/epfl-lts2/gspbox) 
We upload a version of GSPbox, please use gspbox-master.zip, different versions might cause BUG.
